# Contributing

We're looking for contributions of all kinds, whether you have a useful tutorial you'd like to contribute or a project you made!

Our goal is to have mostly projects & other related items that are stable and useful to many users.

## How?

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/shuttle-hq/awesome-shuttle/blob/main/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

## Removing projects

We don't remove projects unless they are outright broken or pronounced deprecated by another project or by its author.
